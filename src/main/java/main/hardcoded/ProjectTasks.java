	 * Make it easier to use the code of this compiler as an API for other projects.

	 * One key feature is that the ParseTreeGenerator should generate more information
	 * and give a developer access to more context about the source code.
	 * The ParseTreeGenerator should keep information about where a expression or block
	 * is stored and what tokens it uses.
	 * It should also provide information about where errors and warnings are located
	 * inside the project with their messages and file locations still there.
