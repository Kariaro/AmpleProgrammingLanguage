This parsetree should keep information about the tokens that was used to create each block/statement and expression.

One rule is that a statement is made of many expressions but an expression is a single line of code.

for   (  int    a         =    3      ; a         <    10     ; a         ++      )  {}
[FOR] -  [TYPE] [LITERAL] [OP] [EXPR] - [LITERAL] [OP] [EXPR] - [LITERAL] [EXPR]  -  [STAT]


Find a way to save tokens so that we can in another program figure out where we need to show errors..
